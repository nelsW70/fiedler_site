              <p>
                Influenced by two older cousins who both played trumpet,
                trombonist/composer Joe Fiedler, born and raised in Pittsburgh,
                PA, and based in NYC since 1993, desperately wanted to become a
                trumpet player himself, but was instead given a trombone by his
                fourth grade music teacher who saw Fiedler and the trombone as a
                good match. The young, shy musician accepted the "arranged
                marriage", and the fourth grade music teacher has since been
                proven prophetic. Fiedler and the trombone finding each other
                coincided with the young musician falling under the abiding
                influence of two albums from his father's collection, The
                Cannonball Adderley Sextet-Mercy, Mercy, Mercy, and Oscar
                Peterson's Night Train.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a period of time at Allegheny College in Pennsylvania,
                with the trombone on the back burner, Fiedler decided to move
                back home and transferred to the University of Pittsburgh, where
                he soon joined the University's jazz band. "Once my flame was
                relit, I was all in, and full on! At that time I had no idea how
                to make a living playing the trombone, but I was just in love
                with practicing and the whole process," commented Fiedler.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon graduating Fiedler quickly becoming an in-demand sideman,
                freelancing for several years in Pittsburgh, including hitting
                the road with the Glenn Miller Orchestra and working in pit
                orchestras for Broadway shows. Shortly after, Fiedler moved to
                New York City in 1993, and two big breaks really opened up a
                career path for the trombonist. He heard through some friends
                who were members of Billy Bang’s quintet that the great Cecil
                Taylor was forming a new large ensemble. As a young, brave,
                talented, and perhaps naïve musician, Fiedler crashed the first
                rehearsal, and when he wasn't asked to leave, he just kept
                showing up. "After a while I guess that I was just in the band.
                While playing with Cecil was great, it was the players that I
                met that led to many other projects, either directly or
                indirectly. Some of those players included: Steve Swell, Susie
                Ibarra, Chris Jonas, Rob Brown, and Chris Lightcap," said
                Fiedler.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <p>
                Fiedler also met many future collaborators through Joey Sellers,
                one of his all time favorite composers/arrangers/ trombonists,
                who was holding open rehearsals at the Local 802 Union with his
                11 piece band. Fiedler explains, "through the grape vine, I
                ended up at one of those rehearsals and was able to stick
                around. Up until then I was a bit mired in the free jazz
                scene—which was cool, but I wanted to play in an open setting,
                but with some harmony and form. (Much in the vein of my hero Ray
                Anderson.) It was in Sellers' band that I finally met a whole
                slew of like-minded players and really felt at home. That band
                included Tony Malaby, Dave Ballou, Dave Berkman and my future
                band mates, John Hebert and Michael Sarin."
              </p>
              <p>
                Since this time, Fiedler, born March 24, 1965, has gone from
                strength to strength, happily entrenched in a whirlwind of
                prestigious sideman activity over the past twenty years (Fiedler
                is one of the first-call trombonists in the world and is
                featured on more than 100 recordings). He has also been modestly
                crafting and releasing an exceptional cluster of recordings as a
                composer and bandleader that has garnered high praise from fans
                and the most revered journalists and critics covering jazz and
                creative music. Further evidence of Fiedler's rising star is his
                appearance on the DownBeat Magazine Critic's Poll for the past
                several years.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the opening notes of his latest recording, I'm In (released
                in April of 2015), Fiedler, bassist Rob Jost and drummer Michael
                Sarin make it clear that this is going to be an adventurous,
                imaginative, funky and fun listen. I'm In is the fourth from the
                latest incarnation of his trio, and the second album on his
                label, Multiphonics Music. The album presents a departure from
                his previous trio sessions, as Fiedler set out to play tunes
                with more traditional jazz forms, and that possessed more blues
                elements. With I'm In Fiedler has once again used his curious
                mind and explorer's heart to great advantage, finding brilliant
                new approaches on his horn, and new heights of mastery with his
                composer's pen.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <p>
                I'm In follows Fiedler's highly acclaimed trio recordings (Plays
                The Music of Albert Mangelsdorff, The Crab and Sacred Chrome Orb
                - albums that put him on the map as a triple threat musician - a
                seriously gifted improviser, an accomplished composer/arranger
                and an imaginative bandleader), so it is an album that has a lot
                to live up to; and it delivers brilliantly on many levels. The
                repertoire is as perfectly balanced as a culinary masterpiece,
                with just the right amount of Latin tunes ("Erstwhile", "In
                Walked Cleo" - written for his daughter), funky explorations
                ("Completely 'Peccable"), swing ("I'm In"), and more than a dash
                of free improvisation for good measure ("Moving In Silence").
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to his Trio, one of most critically-acclaimed
                projects that Fiedler has undertaken as a leader is his band,
                Big Sackbut, featuring Fiedler, Luis Bonilla & Ryan Keberle -
                trombones, and Marcus Rojas - tuba. Big Sackbut was born in the
                late 1980s when Fiedler saw The World Saxophone Quartet live and
                was inspired to form a similar band, using trombones and tuba.
                Fiedler has release two acclaimed albums with Big Sackbut, the
                self-titled debut from the group, Big Sackbut (2012, Yellow
                Sound), and Sackbut Stomp (released in 2013 on Fiedler's own
                Multiphonics Music).
              </p>
              <p>
                Joe Fiedler's career is always moving full steam ahead, and in
                addition to leading his own bands, the aforementioned Big
                Sackbut and The Joe Fiedler Trio, he is currently working with
                Eddie Palmieri, Fast 'n' Bulbous, Viento De Agua (whose first
                album, De Puerto Rico al Mundo, was selected among the Top 10
                Latin albums of the year by The New York Times), the Ed Palermo
                Big Band, Endangered Species-The Music of Wayne Shorter, and
                many others. Fiedler is also in the planning stages for a solo
                trombone project, and is a regular contributor to The Mingus Big
                Band. Fiedler's "day job" is Music Director: Arrangements
                (serving as arranger, orchestrator and trombonist) for Sesame
                Street. Over seven seasons he has written more than 250
                arrangements and crafted more than 5000 underscoring cues.
