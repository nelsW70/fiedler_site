                The New York Times has pinpointed a “feeling for a rugged but
                jaunty experimentalism” in the music of trombone veteran Joe
                Fiedler, a figure as esteemed in New York jazz circles as he is
                in the Afro-Caribbean and pop scenes. He’s an adventurous
                improviser and bandleader whose recordings range from solo
                trombone (The Howland Sessions) to quintet (Like, Strange) to
                trombone/tuba quartet (Big Sackbut, Sackbut Stomp, Live in Graz
                — “the intersection of gutbucket blues and avant-garde
                audacity,” JazzTimes) to chordless trio (The Crab, Sacred Chrome
                Orb, I’m In, Joe Fiedler Plays the Music of Albert
                Mangelsdorff).
              </p>
              <p>
                Fiedler’s two Sesame Street-themed albums to date, Open Sesame
                and Fuzzy and Blue, pay homage to the beloved children’s show
                where Fiedler has worked as a music director for nearly 15
                years. With bold and inventive arrangements of timeless music by
                Joe Raposo, Jeffrey Moss and more, Fiedler grapples with the
                legacy of the storied show of which he’s become an integral
                part. Fuzzy and Blue, opined London Jazz News, is “unnervingly
                satisfying — hitting a note between scripted nostalgia and
                improvised jazz that [is] both exciting and comforting at the
                same time.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Owing to his long experience in pit bands, salsa groups and
                countless other professional settings, Fiedler had the
                opportunity to play trombone for the earliest onstage
                incarnation of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s In the Heights (not long
                before Hamilton’s runaway success). Tony Award-winning
                orchestrator Bill Sherman was on the gig and took to Fiedler,
                bringing him on board the newly revived children’s show Electric
                Company. After three seasons, Sherman and Fiedler made the
                transition in 2009 to Sesame Street. From playing 350 gigs a
                year on the freelance circuit, Fiedler officially became a
                Sesame Street music director, working on what would become
                hundreds of song arrangements and thousands of underscoring cues
                (and still climbing).

              <p>
                A Pittsburgh native and a New Yorker since 1993, Fiedler studied
                at Allegheny College and the University of Pittsburgh before
                launching into work as an in-demand sideman. He’s become one of
                the first-call trombonists in the world, featured on more than
                100 recordings. He’s had extensive experience in the heart of
                the flowering big band scene, playing with Maria Schneider,
                Chico O’Farrill, the Mingus Big Band, Andrew Hill, Jason
                Lindner, Dafnis Prieto, Kenny Wheeler, Satoko Fujii, Miguel
                Zenón and many more. In smaller units he’s played with Lee
                Konitz, Anthony Braxton, Cecil Taylor, Myra Melford, Bobby
                Previte, David Weiss’s Endangered Species and a host of others.
                Fiedler also paid years of dues on the salsa and Latin circuit
                with Celia Cruz, Eddie Palmieri, Willie Colon, Ralph Irizarry
                and other major acts. His pop credits include Jennifer Lopez,
                Marc Anthony, Wyclef Jean, The Four Tops, Melba Moore and Lesley
                Gore, to name a few.

                Without doubt this mass of musical experience filters into the
                trombonist’s mindset, the way he looks at craft, audience, band
                dynamics and perhaps most of all fun. Coming up in the ’80s, he
                recalls his favorite bands as the Jazz Passengers, Carla Bley,
                Ray Anderson — “bands and musicians that had this sense of
                humor, this sense of burlesque,” he says. Recalling the last
                great gasps of the downtown scene and his brushes with the early
                Knitting Factory bands, Fiedler knows that while many of those
                touchstones have disappeared, they live on still in today’s
                sensibilities and methods, for Fiedler as for many likeminded
                peers.

            <div class="col-md-4">
              <p>
                Fiedler’s work has always involved effortlessly hopping the
                boundary between charged free improvisation and music of more
                established tonal and formal parameters — “out” vs. “in,” as
                jazz musicians sometimes call it. He’s apt to draw out long and
                lustrous melodic tones while also manipulating his trombone
                sound with multiphonics and other extended techniques (playing
                one note and singing a higher note, sometimes producing an
                overtone to complete a chord). The deep sense of blues, tailgate
                and other earlier jazz approaches to the horn come through, as
                do the sonic innovations of Albert Mangelsdorff, or the hard-bop
                aesthetics of Slide Hampton and J.J. Johnson. As Jazz Podium
                wrote of his formidable solo trombone recital The Howland
                Sessions: “Fiedler manages to trump the master (Mangelsdorff):
                his chords are even broader, more colorful and more opulent.”
                Binding myriad influences into a signature voice, Fiedler
                continues to amass a reputation as a musical thinker with
                limitless imagination.
